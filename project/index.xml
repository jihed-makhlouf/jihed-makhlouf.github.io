In this project, students are asked to fill out a survey composed of questions related to their learning activities, after each lesson. The students' freely-written comments to each question are helpful to grasp their learning activity. But, the students have to wait a long time before receiving the professor&amp;rsquo;s feedback to their survey answers. Therefore, the aim of this project is twofold. First, we build prediction models of the students' learning experience based on their comments. Second, we automate the process of giving feedback to the students. Therefore, they don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for a long time before receiving the appropriate guidance. This project later evolved into the &lt;a href="jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/coursebot/">&lt;em>CourseBot&lt;/em>&lt;/a> project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coursebot</title><link>jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/coursebot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/coursebot/</guid><description>&lt;p>Based on the findings of the &lt;a href="jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/comments/">&lt;em>Comments Data Mining&lt;/em>&lt;/a> project, we build an integrated platform to support both students and professors during the course. The students will engage in a discussion with a chatbot that will ask them questions related to some predefined aspects about their learning activities. The chatbot gives the appropriate feedback message to each student. Meanwhile, we gather the student textual data, process it, and use predictive models to generate reports for the professor.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>E-book Systems</title><link>jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/e-book/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/e-book/</guid><description>&lt;p>The BookRoll system is an online teaching material delivery system. It is an environment that allows students to have seamless access to the lecture contents, anytime, anywhere. On top of that, it provides additional functionalities that help the students interact with the documents. Moreover, the system gathers and stores students' usage data. Then, this data is used for various analyses. I used data from this system to investigate the students' reading behaviors and predict their scores.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Programming Web Search</title><link>jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/trackthink/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/trackthink/</guid><description>&lt;p>When programmers face problems during programming tasks, they turn to the web to search for a solution. Similarly, students learning to program use the same tools to overcome their problems. Most of the researchers interested in tracking students' programming web search behavior merely store the URL of the visited websites. In this project, we went further by collecting almost all possible data from the students' usage of the web browser. For this, we build a browser extension (mainly Chromium-based browsers) called TrackThink to collect logs such as the tabs management, the page content and viewport, and the scrolling and clipboard usage. Such granular and specific data could not be collected otherwise as it requires advanced access only available through the browsers' extensions APIs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>STEM Career Prediction</title><link>jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/stem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/project/stem/</guid><description>&lt;p>STEM is an abbreviation of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. In recent years, there has been a constant increase in the demand for STEM-related workforce. Moreover, there is a large number of students that lose interest in STEM early or are not fully prepared to participate in these fields. In this context, the team behind the ASSISTments intelligent tutoring system conducted a longitudinal study that led to a data mining competition. Participants are requested to predict which students will pursue a STEM career using data from their interactions with the ASSISTments ITS. In this competition, I won second place and shared my findings in different papers submitted to the educational data mining conference and journal.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
