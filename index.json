It is in this context that we conducted a study to predict the students’ learning experience using a questionnaire. After each lesson, we give the students a questionnaire containing 5 predefined questions relative to their learning activities following the PCN method. Then, students provide their freely-written comments answering these questions. We use these comments to predict their learning experience in an approach to provide meaningful insights to the professor for better interventions. We built models that predict the students’ learning experience using textual data. We investigated 2 approaches to building the models. The baseline approach is to treat all comments of all the questions together. In the second approach, we feed the context of the question to the prediction model using a simple padding technique.

However, enrolling in a STEM major requires specific skills in math and science that are learned in schools. Hopefully, institutions are adopting educational software that collects data from the students' usage.

In this paper, we used data collected from the students' usage of an Intelligent Tutoring System to predict whether or not they would pursue a career in STEM-related fields. We conducted different types of analysis called \"problem-based approach\" and \"skill-based approach\". The problem-based approach focused on evaluating students' actions based on the problems that they solved. Likewise, in the skill-based approach we evaluated their usage based on the skills that they had practiced. Furthermore, we investigated whether or not comparing students' features with those of their peer schoolmates can improve the prediction models in both the skill-based and the problem-based approaches.

In an approach to address this issue, we asked the students to give freely-written comments answering predefined questions about their learning experience. Thereafter, professors read these comments and give feedback to each student. Nonetheless, professors find themselves overwhelmed by the number of comments which make this approach not scalable to multiple classes for the same professor. In this paper, we address this issue by building a model that can automatically assess the students' comments. We use two different approaches. In the first approach, we treat all student comments the same way, regardless of which question they are related to. The second approach consists of building different individual models that analyze students' comments depending on the question.

Efforts have been made to encourage people to pursue a career in STEM fields. Nevertheless, the provision of the skills students require to be capable of pursuing a STEM career starts earlier than college. In fact, students need to be trained from middle school, as it is then that students make their choices. Thanks to the increasing adoption of educational software, detecting students' problems with maths and science subjects has become more efficient. And more recently, models using data gathered from an Intelligent Tutoring System have become capable of predicting STEM or non-STEM college major enrollment. In this paper, we focus on predicting STEM field career choice using longitudinal data from an Intelligent Tutoring System. We investigate if comparing student data to that of their peer school-mates can improve the prediction models. We find that aggregating student levels within the same schools improves prediction models and leads to better AUC scores (0.601) compared to models using student data without this school-based transformation.","tags":["Educational Data Mining","Intelligent Tutoring System","Machine Learning"],"title":"Investigating How School Aggregated Data Can Influence in Predicting STEM Career from Student usage of an Intelligent Tutoring System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jihed Makhlouf","Tsunenori Mine"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531872e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531872e3,"objectID":"b012830b8f79742fd5c765e0496bc61e","permalink":"jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/publication/edm18_poster/","publishdate":"2022-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"jihedmakhlouf.rf.gd/publication/edm18_poster/","section":"publication","summary":"It's been clear for years now that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields workforce have a great impact worldwide.
